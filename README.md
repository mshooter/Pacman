# Pacman
## project
This is the simple pacman game Assignment for Bournemouth University.
I received a basis code and from there I had to continue to implement.
I am using a SDL 2.0 library to use the map data and sprite sheets presented with this assignment.
The project is based upon using this basic framework and extending it to complete the tasks below:
1. Using the supplied map array in map.h implement code to draw blocks for each of the data values in the array.
2. Using the arrow keys or WASD move a simple block (pacman) around the maze but ensure it can only travel in the correct maze areas. 
3. When the block travels over one of the red pills remove it from the maze and replace it with an empty block
4. Allow the block to teleport from left to right on the middle maze crossing sections
5. Using the supplied sprite sheet animate the moving block to become the pacman character, the sprite sheet contains animation for the 4 directions and has 7 frames per animation cycle. 

## additional to the code
I have added sound into the game, everytime pacman eats a red pill it "chomps"
